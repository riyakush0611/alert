Community Safety Alert System: 
1. Medical Emergency Assistance: The app uses the HERE Map API to fetch the user's current location. 
2. Nearby Hospitals: The app lists all nearby hospitals. 
3. Best Route Calculation: We calculate the best route to each hospital, taking traffic congestion into consideration.
 4. Base Time Estimation: The app provides an estimated travel time to each hospital.
5. Community Safety Alert System: Using cutting-edge technologies like HERE Map API and Twilio API, our app ensures timely and efficient help for those in need. 1. Let's dive into the features and functionalities of this service.
Emergency Assistance for Crime and Fire
Comparable Method: The procedure for dealing with fire and criminal crises is the same. The program determines the optimal routes, locates local fire and police services, and sends alert messages containing the user's location.

Bonus Assignment: The Smart City Project
We have created a tool to help the smart city program by identifying locations that do not have easy access to a hospital.

Location Analysis: Within a 5-kilometer radius, the app indicates places without hospitals.
Recommendations: To improve community health infrastructure, we propose that the government build hospitals or medical camps in these underprivileged communities.
The Operation of the Service


Tracking Location: The application keeps track of the user's present location.
Hospital Location: The HERE Map API is used to list all of the surrounding hospitals.
Route Calculation: Taking traffic congestion into account, the program determines the most efficient routes to each hospital.
Base Time Estimate: This calculates the approximate travel time to every hospital.
alarm Message: Using the Twilio API, an alarm message is delivered to a designated emergency contact, containing the user's precise position (ascertained using reverse geocoding).
Analogous Procedure for Additional Emergencies: For the police and fire services, the same procedures are used.
The Community Safety Alert System seeks to make communities safer for all residents by utilizing state-of-the-art technologies and emphasizing both immediate emergency response and long-term infrastructure improvement.
